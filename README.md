- iOS 17.0+ / macOS 14.0+ / watchOS 10.0+ / tvOS 17.0+ / visionOS 1.0+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/SwiftIntelligence.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Then add the modules you need to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourApp",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "SwiftIntelligence", package: "SwiftIntelligence"),
        .product(name: "SwiftIntelligenceNLP", package: "SwiftIntelligence"),
        .product(name: "SwiftIntelligenceVision", package: "SwiftIntelligence")
    ]
)
```

## Quick Start

### Natural Language Processing

```swift
import SwiftIntelligenceNLP

// Initialize NLP engine
let nlpEngine = try await SwiftIntelligenceNLP()

// Analyze sentiment
let sentiment = try await nlpEngine.analyzeSentiment("This framework is amazing!")
print("Sentiment: \(sentiment.sentiment.emoji) Score: \(sentiment.score)")

// Extract entities
let entities = try await nlpEngine.extractEntities("Tim Cook announced iPhone 15 in Cupertino")
for entity in entities {
    print("\(entity.text): \(entity.type.emoji)")
}
```

### Computer Vision

```swift
import SwiftIntelligenceVision

// Initialize Vision engine
let visionEngine = try await SwiftIntelligenceVision()

// Detect objects in image
let objects = try await visionEngine.detectObjects(in: image)
for object in objects {
    print("Found \(object.label) with \(object.confidence)% confidence")
}

// Perform OCR
let text = try await visionEngine.extractText(from: image)
print("Extracted text: \(text)")
```

### Speech Recognition

```swift
import SwiftIntelligenceSpeech

// Initialize Speech engine
let speechEngine = try await SwiftIntelligenceSpeech()

// Start speech recognition
let transcription = try await speechEngine.startRecognition()
print("You said: \(transcription)")

// Text-to-speech
try await speechEngine.speak("Hello from SwiftIntelligence!")
```

## Demo Apps

The framework includes comprehensive demo applications showcasing all features:

- **iOS Demo**: Full-featured iOS app with examples for all modules
- **macOS Demo**: Desktop application demonstrating framework capabilities
- **SwiftUILab**: 120+ production-ready UI components

## Architecture

SwiftIntelligence follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:
