## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Quick Guidelines

- **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- **DO** use GitHub Security Advisories for private reporting
- **DO** provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- **DO** give us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure

### How to Report

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)**
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/muhittincamdali/SwiftIntelligence/security/advisories) 
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the security advisory form

2. **Email (Alternative)**
   - Send details to: security@swiftintelligence.dev
   - Use PGP encryption if possible (key available on request)

### What to Include

Please include the following information:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, data exposure, privilege escalation)
- **Affected component/module** (e.g., SwiftIntelligenceNLP, SwiftIntelligenceVision)
- **Attack scenario** - How an attacker could exploit this
- **Impact assessment** - What data/functionality could be compromised
- **Proof of concept** - Steps to reproduce or demonstration code
- **Suggested fix** - If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Varies by severity (1-30 days)
- **Security Release**: As soon as fix is ready and tested
- **Public Disclosure**: 90 days after fix release (negotiable)

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels:

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution without authentication
- Complete system compromise
- Mass data exposure

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Privilege escalation
- Authentication bypass
- Significant data exposure

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Local privilege escalation
- Limited data exposure
- Denial of service

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Information disclosure
- Minor functionality bypass
